# Pneumonia Detector


Pneumonia is an infection that inflames the air sacs in the lungs. The air sacs may be fill with fluid or pus, causing cough with phlegm or pus, fever, chills, and difficulty breathing. This infection can be caused by several organisms as bacterias, viruses or fungi. 

Chest X-Ray images can be useful in the diagnosis of Pneumonia. A doctor can diagnose it, know the extent and the location of the infection by looking at an X-Ray image withing a few seconds or minutes. 

The aim of this project is to be able to automatize the diagnosis of Pneumonia given a chest X-Ray image by using Convolutional Neural Networks. If this task can be sucessfully achieved by a machine, then it will help doctors to save a lot of time that could be used in other actions.
